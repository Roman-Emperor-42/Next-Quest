# Next-Quest

Finding new video games that match your interests can be difficult due to the vast amount of games. Our project strives to build a recommendation system that builds off of what you currently play and other users' reviews.

## Description

We propose building a video game recommendation system where users create profiles, import profiles, input preferences, and receive personalized game suggestions. At a higher level, the system will store user data, apply recommendations, and display results in a simple UI. The target users are gamers looking for new games that don’t want to sift through the endless pages of game stores.
